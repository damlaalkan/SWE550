I would like to explain steps that I have completed for Assignment 2.

Assignment2

This homework is about model based testing. I want you to download and learn the following tools.

1- Graphwalker (https://graphwalker.github.io/) , look at the examples on their website 

2- Appium:  http://appium.io/  Selenium: https://www.selenium.dev/

- Choose a mobile application (Android or IOS) or a webapp. Post your choice on discussion forum. No two same applications.

- Then write at least 4 different model based test scenarios for the chosen application in Graphwalker (through Graphwalker studio). Write scenarios for  happy paths and not so happy paths.  (e.g. valid inputs and invalid inputs)

- Then using Graphwalker you are going to generate test case templates from your test scenarios wrt random and other coverage criteria.

- Then you will implement the functionality of the nodes and edges in your template in Java.

Submit all your documents as a zip file. Include a README describing your test scenarios. You will demo your assignment.

1. Graph Walker Studio setup  : http://graphwalker.github.io/

2. Download Java 

3. run local host : http://localhost:9090/studio.html
